# Redux-Basic
This is a simple application I made to get familiar with and test the basic syntax and structuring of Redux combined with React. This app is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and of course Node, React, and Redux. It is an app that has a list of book objects and the user can selet a book to view the information about that book. The main point of this app was for me to get familiarized with managing the application's state using Redux. I had to utilize various methods to connect the apllication's Redux reducers with the React companents to make containers. I was able to change the app's state by creating actions and dispatching them across all of the reducers in the app.
